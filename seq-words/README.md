# seq-words

Extracting sequentially appearing words from data generated by [soap-seq](../soap-seq).

## Setup

1. Install the [Rust environment](https://rustup.rs/).

2. Place the CSV file generated by [soap-seq](../soap-seq) in the project root, naming it `sample.csv`.

3. Execute the command `cargo run --release`.

The program will generate two output files:
- `output.csv`: Contains all sequential words.
- `output-refined.csv`: Contains a refined subset with duplicates removed.
